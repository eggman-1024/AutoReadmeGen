## About <a name = "about"></a>

ðŸ˜« Have you ever been frustrated by creating numerous similarly named files when testing code? A few days later, you might get confused about these files. You may have created many files named `test`, `test1`, `test2`...... and then completely forgotten their purposes.


ðŸŽ‰ Now you can use this extension to automatically generate an `autoReadme.md` file based on the file structure of the selected directory, with the following powerful features:

- **Customizable Directory Levels**: You can choose the depth of directories to record (default is 0 for current directory only, set to -1 to expand all subdirectories)
- **File Filtering**: Exclude files or directories that don't need to be recorded through the `.readignore` file
- **Automatic Updates**: Automatically update document content when the directory structure changes

## Demo

Watch the demo video to see how AutoReadmeGen works:

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

<!-- These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. -->

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```  -->

### Installing

- Open `Visual Studio Code`.
- Go to Extensions or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+Shift+X`or `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
- Search for `AutoReadmeGen`.
- Install the extension.
- Restart `Visual Studio Code` and your project.


## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

1. Right-click on the target folder in the Explorer
2. Select `AutoReadmeGen` from the context menu
3. Enter the directory level to record (default is 0)

The system will create the following files in the selected directory:
- `autoReadme.md`: A document containing the corresponding file structure
- `.readignore`: Used to specify file or directory patterns to be ignored

### .readignore File

The `.readignore` file works similarly to `.gitignore`, where you can add file or directory patterns to be excluded from the documentation, one per line. When you create a new `.readignore` file, it will be automatically populated with default ignore patterns configured in the extension settings. For example:

```
node_modules/
*.log
.git/
```

You can customize the default ignore patterns in the extension settings.

### Automatic Updates

When the directory structure changes, the `autoReadme.md` file will be automatically updated, taking into account the rules in the `.readignore` file.
